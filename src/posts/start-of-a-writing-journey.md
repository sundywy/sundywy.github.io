# Start of a writing journey

This post has been long time coming. I always have this urge to start blogging, but always put it behind the back of my thought. Most of the times because I was afraid that I don't have the flair to write a good post. But we always start as beginner, so here we go.

This blog will be my medium on how learning how to think through writing, and also to improve my english grammar (I'm a grammar geek). This idea started when I read `Writing to learn` which is a book by William Zinnsser and from my admiration to people from 37 signals like DHH and Jorge Manrubia that can express their thinking in writing. I especially admire how they can breakdown complex technical problem into a small and simple parts.  And after watching Jordan Peterson describing how writing is a form of thinking deeply in a problem, it motivates me more to start writing.

This blog will also make me more accountable on my learning journey, which is what I'll share here. By writing, I can be more focused and selective on what I learn and be more discipline in journaling about it. By writing it down, I can break a complex problem into small and simple things that I can digest. Like what have been always said, you can only master a problem after you teach it to other people. And that other people might be my future self.

I also want to use this platform for me to experiment on web development. Most of my professional experiences have been working as backend engineer. Web development was alien to me, mainly because of my fear to CSS . This change after going through responsive web design course by Kevin Powell (thanks Kevin). This site is the result of it. However I'm still a beginner, so it will look crappy at first.

Mostly I'll write about things that interest me. Right now I'm learning full stack web framework such as Rails and Laravel. I'm also exploring low level programming (Zig, C and assembly) and functional programming (Ocaml). Occasionally I'll write about CSS techniques that I find interesting. Maybe I'll also share something about Fortran, the first programming language I used professionally.

In the end, the main audience for this blog will be me. Hopefully it's useful for others as well.
